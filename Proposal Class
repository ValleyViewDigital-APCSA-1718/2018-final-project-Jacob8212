Space Survival
Description:
This game is a single player game that uses the feature of using the mouse to move the rocket in the Greenfoot screen. The objective in this game is to shoot your way past the avalanche of asteroids in the mist of space. The asteroid rocks would spawn randomly on the right side of the screen, will head towards the rocket, and it is up to the player to shoot through the rock storm in order to survive.

How to Play:
Utilize the computer mouse to move the rocket while it automatically shoots sideways on the screen. Avoid contact with every asteroid rock that comes toward you!

Interesting Features:
Features like being able to maneuver the rocket with the movement of the mouse and the rocket shooting automatically are the interesting features that make the concept of the game. The barrage of asteroid rocks randomly come toward the rocket at different speeds is another interesting feature in one of the gameâ€™s classes.
